# COVID-19-DETECTION
In our Project we implemented on classification method Early detection of Detecting COVID-19is crucial in reducing mortality. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be a viable imaging technique for Detecting COVID-19detection have been studied for computed tomography (CT) images. However, to the best of our knowledge, no detection methods have been carried out for the MR images. In this paper, a Detecting COVID-19 detection method based on deep learning is proposed for thoracic MR images. With parameter optimizing, spatial three-channel input construction, and deep  learning, a faster R-convolution neural network (CNN) is designed to locate the Detecting COVID-19 region.

PROPOSED METHOD


INPUT IMAGE
PRE-PROCESSING
GLCM FEATURE EXTRACTION
CONVENTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK 

A. INPUT IMAGE

The input image process was done by this project because there are no publicly available datasets about chest dataset. However, dataset images accurately represent the state of the affected and normal. This is unlikely in less-affected regions and is also treated because images are clear and with blurring. which will plan on making a public dataset in the future. The dataset contains images of development stages of covid 19 x rays datasets across two classes with about normal and abnormal. Some of the input image the figure 3.1.

B. PREPROCESSING
	  
   Image pre-processing is the term for operations on images like changing the RGB image to a gray one by adjusting the resolution of the image as needed. These operations don't increase image information content however they decrease it if entropy is associate degree metric. Applying the bilateral filter and Gaussian filter is used to enhance the quality of the image. The point of preprocessing is partner degree improvement of the picture data that stifles undesirable twists or upgrades some picture choices pertinent for more procedure and investigation tasks.

C. FEATURE EXTRACTION

      Feature Extraction expects to decrease the number of highlights in a dataset by making new features from the current ones. This new diminished arrangement of the feature should then have the option to outline the vast majority of the data contained in the first arrangement of the feature. Right now, outlined adaptation of the first features can be made from a blend of the first set.

3.3.1 DWT

	Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) gives an ideal reconstruction of the sign upon reversal. This implies you can take the discrete wavelet transform of a flag and afterward utilize the coefficients to blend a careful generation of the sign to inside numerical precision. You can execute a reverse DWT, however, it is regularly the situation that the remaking isn't great. Remaking a sign from the DWT coefficients is a considerably less steady numerical activity.
